### Benchmarking scripts - please note that benchmarks take several hours to run. 

To benchmark TS
```shell
benchmark.py TS
```    

To benchmark RWS
```shell
benchmark.py RWS
```

Thse scripts will create csv files in the current directory. The benchmarks run each of 109 query molecules 10 times, so it takes several hours to run.  I start a tmux session for TS and another for RWS, then run in each of those sessions.
